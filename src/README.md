Identity Secret NodeJS Service

Several online services allow a user to provide an Identity for authentication and authorization into other services. The user's given Identity however is not privacy protected. This design would implement an online service that allows the user to remain anonymous while still providing a verifiable Identity and any other associated attributes. The service would prove to consumers that the given Identity is registered to a real person and the requested verifiable attributes belong to that person, without revealing the Identity itself.
